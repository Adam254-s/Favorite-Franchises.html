    <p>Throughout my life there were so many franchises that I loved and grew up with that I'd basically wouldn't know what my life would've been without them. So here are some of my favorite franchises that I still love to this day.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class='card'>
    <h2>Sonic The Hedgehog</h2>
  <div id="Sonic">
      <img src="media/Sonic.jpg" alt="An image of Sonic The Hedgehon from the comics issue 180.">
  </div> 
    <p>This blue hedgehog has been around in my life ever since I was in kindegarden. I loved Sonic so much and yet despite it's terrible decade which was the 2010's. The franchise now looks like it's thriving once again. Now, I'm starting to become more of a Sonic fan than a Mario fan because as I got older, I feel like the series has also grown up on me as well.</p>

    <h2>Yu-Gi-Oh</h2>
  <div id="Yugioh">
    <img src="media/img2.jpg" alt="Showcasing all the series in Yu-Gi-Oh">
  </div> 
    <p>I really wish that I saw this series more when I was a kid, but I couldn't find it anywhere except on Nick Toons. When I finally watched this series. I fell in absolute love with it. I just love the cards and the characters portrayed in this franchise. Yes, modern Yu-Gi-Oh is ridiculous with all of it's insane combo decks but just like Pokemon, This series will always have a big place in my heart. My favorite series being 5D's.</p>

    <h2>Pokemon</h2>
    <div id="Pokemon">
      <img src="media/Pokemon.jpg" alt="Showcasing all the Pokemon generations">
    </div> 
      <p>Pokemon has been a huge impact on my life my first gen being gen 4 and gen 5 being my absolute favorite generation based on it's characters, the story, and the Pokemon overall, Hyderigon best dragon type pokemon baby!</p>

    <h2>Mario</h2>
  <div id="Mario">
      <img src="media/Mario.png" alt="Showing my love for the mario franchise">
  </div> 
    <p>I love Nintendo games! They were what introduced me to gaming all the way back when I was a wee little toddler. The gamecube was my first system and I had a blast playing Mario Kart Double Dash. Mario Party 7, Super Mario Bros Wii and especially Mario Sports Mix. Now, My favorite Mario game is Mario Galaxy and the two game close to it are Mario Odyssey, and 3D World + Bowser's Fury. I still have fun playing Mario and hope that the franchise will continue to get better and not play it safe all the time.</p>

  <div class='card'>
    <h2>Dragon Ball</h2>
  <div id="DragonBall">
      <img src="media/Dragon Ball.jpg" alt="Showing an image of one of my favorite fighting games from my favorite franchise Dragon ball.">
  </div>
    <p>Dragon ball was the hypest thing I've ever witnessed when I was a little kid, I remember imitading what Dragon Ball Characters do because I loved the way they powered up and used their special attacks. Playing the new game as if me typing this and I don't care what people have to say, it's my favorite fighting game of all time. Sparking Zero is just all hype although I do understand people's complaints about it. Dragon Ball has been a big part of my childhood and I enjoyed every second of it. My favorite saga being both the Android saga and Cell saga. Trunks, Gohan, and Cell were beasts!</p>

    <h2>Teen Titans</h2>
	<div id="TeenTitans">
      <img src="media/Teen Titans.jpg" alt="Showing an image of my first DC show and my most favorite of all time!.">
    </div>
	<p>Teen Titans was my first DC animated show that I watched when I was little. I remember loving watching this show and just loving everything on what the characters did and went through. My favorite episode being never more and seeing Robin overcoming slade and beating him. I wish this show would come back for one more season just to have a satistying feeling. Raven best Titan easily. Always loved her since she was my favorite and her battle with Trigon was very emotional and epic.</p>

	<h2>Kirby</h2>
	<div>
		<img src="media/Kirby.jpg" alt= "The franchise that I love just as much as Mario"
	</div>
	
	<p>When I was a kid, I was really into the Kirby franchise. I just loved Kirby's character because he was so cute and the fact that I can just suck people up and get their powers. This franchise may not be as successful or popular as other nintendo franchises here in America but, it still has a lot of potential to reach that level of success since Forgotten Land was their best selling game in a long time. I loved watching the Kirby anime Right Back At Ya and I wish the series continued. We could've had another season focusing on Zero being the next main villain after nightmare, and introducing new characters like Gooey and Adeline into the show. I would've loved to see Gooey because he could be like Kirby brother since they both can do copy abilities. It would also be amazing to see Bandana Waddle Dee and King DeDeDe having a redemption arc.</p>
